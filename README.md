# xmip-core-transport-bacnet

BACnet/IP transport: one BVLC-framed NPDU over UDP is one Stream, ASHRAE 135 Annex J. A technology of [xmip-core-transport](https://github.com/IlleNilsson/xmip-core-transport).

A Send Location sends from one socket per address family, bound on its first send and kept by the transport and its clones (`transport::sender::Sender`), so an IPv6 target is reached too; until 2026-09-27 every send bound a new IPv4 socket.

A Receive Location keeps its socket, bound on the first receive (`transport::kept::Kept`): a datagram that arrives between two receives waits in its buffer for the next, where until 2026-09-27 each receive bound a socket of its own and a datagram sent between receives was lost.
